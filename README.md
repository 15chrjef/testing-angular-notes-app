# Testing Angular Controllers, Directives and Services
## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


Unit testing is a key tool for ensuring the correctness of our software. Angular apps are no exception! In fact, part of what makes Angular so amazing is that it is a framework written from the ground up with testing in mind. 

If you haven't unit tested an Angular application before, you might not be aware that there are some extra features that we can use to make testing easier, such as hooking into Angular's dependency injection, and using angular-mocks for a range of test-friendly utilities.

In these Coffee Break Courses, designed to teach a new skill or concept in a single sitting, Envato Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will show you how to take an existing Angular app and add tests for its controller, services and directives.
